# Demetia-Deaths-Greece-v.-Europe

The purpose of this project was to study the existence of an increasing trend in the dementia deaths  of Greece or whether the behavior of Greece is different than the rest of the Europe. We are given a dataset with the dementia deaths per European country for the years 2011 â€“ 2021, by gender. 

But, our research was not based solely on the dataset we were given since the dementia deaths of a country is not a standalone metric for comparison due to the fact that each country does not have the same number of total deaths per year. Therefore, we decided to use more datasets which are also provided in this repository. 

Every dataset used can be found in the [Eurostat database](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database).

This project concerns the course Data Visualization and Communication for M.Sc. in Data Science (AUEB).
